# responsive-portfolio
This is a project from Traversy Media's YouTube Channel to make a Responsive Portfolio Web Page

# What I did
- I created this following Traversy Media's [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYzHS-n2gqU&list=PLillGF-RfqbYoGoCjKoMOkVznV6aSXKzU) series.
- I added my own projets to the project page.
- Added buttons to the contact page that have an animation to them instead of the way Traversy had them in his series.
- Added my own info everywhere instead of Lorem
